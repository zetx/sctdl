Zetx's ScT DLer - Series 1

A couple of big changes in v1. First, the code has been reorganized so that all user variables are in config.rb. Secondly, the script will do basic checks to see if the RSS feed is accessible. 

config.rb variables
 passkey - Your ScT passkey
 verbose - Toggles whether to display messages or not (includes "Waiting...", "GET:", "EXISTS:")
 wait_secs - How many seconds to wait before checking the feed again
 always_check - Toggles whether or not to always check if the script can access the RSS feed (if it can't it'll stop the script)
 download_path - Where it downloads the torrents
 filter_list - Filter list's name
 sct - URL to the RSS feed (excluding passkey)

Filter Syntax:
Category|Title1|Title2|...|

-- You must end with a | or the last item will not be parsed properly!
-- If you wish to download anything from a category, you must have two |'s at the end (see example).

Example:
TV.HR/XViD|Heroes|
TV/XViD|House|
